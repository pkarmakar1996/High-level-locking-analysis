# High-level-locking-analysis
<br>
In this repository, we publish the analysis of area and latency overheads. We perform our analysis on two benchmarks AES and APDCM.
<br>
The repository consists of Direct RTL locked designs and the C locked designs separately.
<be>
Benchmarks are locked with different key sizes.
<br>  
Anyone using it kindly shall cite our work, "Analyzing Area and Latency Overhead in C and RTL Locked Designs".
